        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the 2022 edition of SSTM. SSTM Track aims to explore security, safety and trust management.</p>
        <h2>ABOUT SSTM 2022</h2>
        <p>The continuously evolving nature of today’s internet outdates the existing security and safety mechanisms and therefore there is an emerging need to propose robust, powerful and reliable solutions. These advancements have a great impact on the software and system architectures, resulting in a highly dynamic smart networked environment. The systems used within these complex environments have at least two things in common, namely, the need to restrict or grant access for the required resources based on security policy to face security threats, and the need to sustain resilience of the environment in face of safety hazards. Both aspects should consider trust.</p>
	<p>Thie SSTM’22 track addresses security, safety and trustworthiness on these channels and systems, which play an important role in system and application development. The ways to achieve security, safety and trustworthiness rely on:</p>


        <ul style="list-style-position: outside;">
             <li>Providing unified approaches able to specify and interpret the security policies, relationships and credentials and is able to allow direct authentication for security critical activities. </li>
             <li>Building trust among different entities involved in the system, so that the security of the sensitive resources could be ensured more effectively.</li>
             <li>Establishing different levels of trust within the systems involved in the network, which can actually improve the security and cooperation among the various network entities and can also help in reducing the malicious activities and the safety hazards.</li>
       </ul>

<p>As these environments combine systems and applications of different nature, they have different notions for what a resource could possibly be or do, and have different security policies, information assurance needs and safety rules. For example, the network bandwidth could be a resource for a web browser, individual records a resource for a database server, money and accounts resources for a banking application, etc. The track aim to collect contributions in the line of developing a generic security and safety management mechanism that is reliable enough to handle multiple types and numbers of resources for different nature of applications and systems, which the existing mechanisms are unable to handle. These should possibly be developed under a co-engineering approach which considers both security threats and safety hazards.
</p>
	<p>The goal of SSTM’22 is to attract young researchers, Ph.D. students, practitioners, and industry experts to bring contributions in the area of Security, Safety and Trust Management, especially in the developments of computing, management and programming models, technologies, application frameworks and middleware.</p>
